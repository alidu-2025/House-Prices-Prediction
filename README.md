Project Overview
This notebook tackles the classic regression problem using data exploration, feature engineering, and machine learning models. The dataset is taken from Kaggleâ€™s House Prices competition and refined through:

Data Cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Model Selection & Evaluation

Hyperparameter Tuning

ðŸ§  Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Seaborn, Matplotlib

Scikit-Learn

Jupyter Notebook

ðŸš€ How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
